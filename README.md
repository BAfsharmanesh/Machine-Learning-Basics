# Python 

## Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

1. [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
1. [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
1. [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
1. [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp) is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
